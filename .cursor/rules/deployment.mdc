# Deployment Commands

When deploying HintGrid, ALWAYS use the npm scripts:

## Full Deploy (hosting + database rules)
```bash
npm run deploy
```
This runs: `npm run build && firebase deploy`

## Hosting Only
```bash
npm run deploy:hosting
```
This runs: `npm run build && firebase deploy --only hosting`

## Database Rules Only
```bash
npm run deploy:rules
```
This runs: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

**NEVER** run `firebase deploy` or `npm run build` separately. Always use the combined scripts.
